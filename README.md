# ETL-Project
Instructions:
ETL_Mini_Project_JCounts.ipynb contains the Jupyter noteook reflecting all of my work for creating the dataframes and extracting the requisite csv files. I worked alone on this project.
The exported csv files can be found under Resources/Extract_CSV. All 4 of the exported csv files are included here.
The required ERD made with QuickDBD is ERD.png
The database schema is crowdfunding_db_schema.sql

Please let me know if you have any issues with access!
Thank you,
    Jules
